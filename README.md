# -IPL-DATA-ANALYSIS-AND-VISUALISATION-PROJECT-USING-PYTHON-
This project is an analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 season using Python. The analysis includes various aspects of the game such as batting, bowling, and fielding. The project uses data from the IPL website and various other sources to provide insights into the performance of teams and players.

The project includes the following modules:

Data Collection: This module collects data from various sources such as the IPL website, ESPNcricinfo, and others. The data collected includes match details, player details, and ball-by-ball data.
Data Cleaning: This module cleans the collected data and prepares it for analysis. The cleaning process includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data into a suitable format for analysis.
Data Analysis: This module performs various analyses on the cleaned data. The analyses include:
Batting Analysis: This includes analyzing the performance of batsmen in terms of runs scored, strike rate, and average.
Bowling Analysis: This includes analyzing the performance of bowlers in terms of wickets taken, economy rate, and average.
Fielding Analysis: This includes analyzing the performance of fielders in terms of catches taken, run-outs, and stumpings.
Team Performance: This includes analyzing the performance of teams in terms of wins, losses, and net run rate.
Visualization: This module visualizes the results of the analysis using various Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The visualizations include bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
The project uses various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
This code calculates the batting average and bowling economy rate of each player and visualizes it using bar charts. The data used in this code is loaded from CSV files named 'matches.csv' and 'ball_by_ball.csv'.

The project can be used to gain insights into the performance of teams and players in the IPL 2023 season. The analysis can help in making informed decisions regarding team selection, player performance, and strategy.

The project can be further extended by including more data sources, performing more in-depth analysis, and using more advanced visualization techniques.
